# Skin_Lesion_image_analysis
Analyzed 25,331 skin lesion images (taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salviohexia/isic-2019-skin-lesion-images-for-classification)) which was the ISIC challenge in 2019 as part of a group course project in Fall 2022. 

* Implemented CNN (in R) with 80% test set accuracy to classify all the 25,331 Skin Lesion Images.
* Implemented Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique (SMOTE) in R to address the heavy data imbalance observed in the dataset.
* Analyzed the weakness of standard techniques like bagging, boosting, random forests, and SVM over CNN.
* Implemented convolutional autoencoder(in TensorFlow) to perform dimension reduction.
